#### Todo  #####

- Interpolate the trace (3rd order poly or splines)
- replicate saving format (almost done - need trial times to thoroughly check)
- write scoring function 
- record scaling factor (from trace to norm units)
- draw the box (use any of the vertices)
- when n_trials > number of trials in the file, show repeat trials but randomise and stratify
- save data in pixel units
- save some overarching info: total len, path length, speed etc (check matlab, pd_interaktiv)
- add in ability to draw broken lines (when finishWhenRaise == False)
- put in RGB colour values
- create a YAML for repo
-  min number of points for smooth curve?
