#### Todo  #####

- replicate saving format (almost done - need trial times to thoroughly check) 
- when n_trials > number of trials in the file, show repeat trials but randomise and stratify
- save some overarching info: total len, path length, speed etc (check matlab, pd_interaktiv)
- add in ability to draw broken lines (when finishWhenRaise == False)
- put in RGB colour values (monitor gamut error)
- create a YAML for repo
-  min number of points for smooth curve?
- overall, how does one decide whether a func should be imported or be a method?
- write docstrings, clean up code etc
- log messages arent writing to log file ,fix
- compute blockwise performance in one func, remove feature calculation from happening during the trial
    > dynamic saving? write traces to file during experiment, calc data afterwards?
- fix image template - open dont replace 
- in matlab, individual trials are saved as well as the block but the values are the same


#### Questions ####
- is manyshape thickness and smoothness ok? (if its going to be used)
- how fine do we want delta_t? should I record the exact time gap between each point?
    -> now record the t at each point where do we go from here? calculate an avg anduse that (current)
- dict format is basically ready for saving, but should the saving be in matlab format also?
- where should number of trials be specified? when creatin the obj or for each individual block?
- when shuffling the order or the trials, should they be shuffled in such a way taht the same trial isnt
shown twice in succession?
- units?
- sample data does not match matlab results
- inceasing trace thickenss suffers from same problems as template in terms of interpolation


#### misc ####
- using manyshape resutls in ~35 points captured per sec, 70 per sec is for normal
- need to check indexing, and decide on a convention (trial_idx starts from 1 but stimuli_idx 0)
- dropped frames occur between trials, not during (i think)



### meeting #####
16:10 ratio screen
generate drawn images from templates, use matplotlib or plotly
mayeb separate program sep traceautomated, recford mouse movement use both
print out timestep
hisogram delta t

compare thickness in matlab!!!


dict in list!

save with pandas df (pickles or hdf or csv) <- look at different sizes and speeds (csv if below 300mb)

cm or m per second

check matlab for units (keep same units as matlab)
