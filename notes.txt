#### Todo  #####

- replicate saving format (almost done - need trial times to thoroughly check) 
    > session folder 
        >copydraw block folder
            -tscore for each trial:
                : templateLet
                : theBox
                : id #index
                : traceLet
                : trialTime
                : prett
                : trialstart
                : theword
                : score
            -tinfo
                : trialsVector: names,places,types,lengths,ids
                    
        > info runs
            - block settings:
                : VPcode
                : n_trials
                : letter_time
                : image_size
                : n_letters
                : block_name
                : root_dir
                : finishwhenraised
        -scores:
            : scores
            : finExp?
- save some overarching info: total len, path length, speed etc (check matlab, pd_interaktiv)
- add in ability to draw broken lines (when finishWhenRaise == False)
- put in RGB colour values (monitor gamut error)
- create a YAML for repo
-  min number of points for smooth curve?
- write docstrings, clean up code etc: PEP8!!!
- log messages arent writing to log file ,fix
- compute blockwise performance in one func, remove feature calculation from happening during the trial
    > dynamic saving? write traces to file during experiment, calc data afterwards? : started, need to write calc funcs
- in matlab, individual trials are saved as well as the block but the values are the same
- need to copy perfomance analysis plot each blocks performance
- just "stim" missing from processed scores
- handle nans!


#### Questions ####
- is manyshape thickness and smoothness ok? (if its going to be used)
- how fine do we want delta_t? should I record the exact time gap between each point?
    -> now record the t at each point where do we go from here? calculate an avg anduse that (current)
- units? matlab appears to be in pix
- sample data does not match matlab results: found bug, should have fixed this, not checked yet
- inceasing trace thickenss suffers from same problems as template in terms of interpolation
- how close do scores need to be to matlab ones?
- matlab implies nans when the pen is lifted off - implement that too? Where in the pipeline should it be handled
- how is stim entered? detected, or manually and for a block or trial?


#### misc ####
- need to check indexing, and decide on a convention (trial_idx starts from 1 but stimuli_idx 0)
- dropped frames occur between trials, not during (i think)



### meeting #####
16:10 ratio screen, DONE
generate drawn images from templates, use matplotlib or plotly, DONE
mayeb separate program sep traceautomated, recford mouse movement use both
print out timestep
hisogram delta t: looks good majority below 7ms

compare thickness in matlab!!!


dict in list!

save with pandas df (pickles or hdf or csv) <- look at different sizes and speeds (csv if below 300mb)

cm or m per second

check matlab for units (keep same units as matlab) : seems to be in pix

pep8

cprofile snakeviz

points of least distance dist t: 3rd party implementation, dtw-python? (run through a full dataset) investigate which step pattern

folder!

exec_block(cfg, stim=str)

config file, yaml

rename infor runs to output

be able to run test_exp flow
