#### Todo  #####

- replicate saving format (almost done - need trial times to thoroughly check)
- write scoring function 
- record scaling factor (from trace to norm units)
- when n_trials > number of trials in the file, show repeat trials but randomise and stratify
- save data in pixel units
- save some overarching info: total len, path length, speed etc (check matlab, pd_interaktiv)
- add in ability to draw broken lines (when finishWhenRaise == False)
- put in RGB colour values
- create a YAML for repo
-  min number of points for smooth curve?


#### Questions ####
- is manyshape thickness and smoothness ok?
- how fine do we want delta_t? should I record the exact time gap between each point?
    -> now record the t at each point where do we go from here?


#### misc ####
- using manyshape resutls in ~40 points captured per sec, 80 per sec is for normal
